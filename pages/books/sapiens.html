  <div style="width: 500px">
    <p>Starting from this provocative idea, Sapiens goes on to retell the history of our species from a completely fresh perspective. 
      It explains that money is the most pluralistic system of mutual trust ever devised; that capitalism is the most successful religion ever invented; 
      that the treatment of animals in modern agriculture is probably the worst crime in history; 
      and that even though we are far more powerful than our ancient ancestors, we arenâ€™t much happier.
